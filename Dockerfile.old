#### Stage 1: Build the application
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine as build

# Set the current working directory inside the image
WORKDIR /

# Copy maven executable to the image
COPY mvnw .
COPY .mvn .mvn

# Copy the pom.xml file
COPY pom.xml .

# Build all the dependencies in preparation to go offline. 
# This is a separate step so the dependencies will be cached unless 
# the pom.xml file has changed.
# RUN ./mvnw dependency:go-offline -B

# Copy the project source
COPY src src

# Package the application
RUN ./mvnw package -DskipTests
RUN cp target/mutantsDnaAPI-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar mutants.jar

#### Stage 2: A minimal docker image with command to run the app 
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-slim

# Copy project dependencies from the build stage
COPY --from=build mutants.jar mutants.jar 
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["java","-jar","mutants.jar "]
